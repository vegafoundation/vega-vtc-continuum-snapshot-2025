## Executive Summary

This white paper presents **VTC Continuum Snapshot** as a conceptual contribution to the Resonance Data and QIRC ecosystem. It defines the concept, establishes boundaries, and positions it within the broader Vega Continuum framework.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Current systems lack frameworks for:
- Modeling meaning as dynamic, temporal states
- Distinguishing information from insight and wisdom
- Representing relevance through resonance rather than similarity

**VTC Continuum Snapshot** addresses these gaps conceptually.

---

## 2. Conceptual Framework

**VTC Continuum Snapshot** is positioned as:

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Type | Conceptual Framework |
| Domain | Resonance Data Ecosystem |
| Status | VSP-Compliant Publication |
| Claims | No new physics, no consciousness |

---

## 3. Core Principles

1. **Meaning precedes mechanism**
2. **Resonance over similarity**
3. **Coherence over accumulation**
4. **Stability over time defines wisdom**
